# HIGH LEVEL ALGORITHM.
# 1. First extract the Most Actives, Gainers and Losers stocks.
# 2. This is done by accessing the div and then iteratively accessing the table data using the 'findAll' method.
# 3. Once we have the Most Actives, Gainers and Losers stocks, request the user to enter a companys' symbol.
# 4. Generate the URL of the company by accessing the <a href> tag of the particular company.
# 5. Navigate to the company's page using the above generated URL.
# 6. Now extract Today's Trading information in the same way as the Most Actives, Gainers and Losers stocks.
# 7. Finally, write the data onto a CSV file which is opened in append mode to prevent any data loss.
